Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	fork is like you to make a copy repository directly on the GitHub server without pulling down to local machine. Clone is allow to copy repository from GitHub to local machine. Branch is creating new version in single repository
