When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When i want to intend to share my work to public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	avoid conflict and we can control the changes that are made on our local system

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	fork is like you to make a copy repository directly on the GitHub server without pulling down to local machine. Clone is allow to copy repository from GitHub to local machine. Branch is creating new version in single repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	it is easier to commit your change to last state remote without change your local commit

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	i must send files over via email or face-to-face to my collaborators to show them what i've changed. It really easier because you dont have to learn git or github but it would be harder if you want to check your history repository or want to merge with others
